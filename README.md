<h1 align="center">Deposit Dashboard</h1>

## Introduction
The dashboard provides a deposit tool  for digital content to be injected to Rosetta. The solution also provides an UI for users to browse and manage the deposit jobs.
A primary use case for this solution is scanning the given root location of each material flow and trying to create deposit jobs when there are new SIPs (sub-folders). Once the deposit jobs are created successfully, the dashboard would get a SIP-Id from Rosetta, and the dashboard will check the status of the job by polling the progress from Rosetta according to the SIP-Id.

## Getting started
